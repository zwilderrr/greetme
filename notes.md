### what i want

- two goals
- ability to hide them

### problems

- centering the goals on typing and displaying
- widths jumping when clicking between goals
- logic to show the second goal and how wide it was got complex
- narrow goals hide placeholder text

### solutions

- edit and save buttons show a left-aligned view
- only make one goal
- edit goal modal
- plus sign to add a goal
- keeping the goals slightly off center until a max width is achieved
- allowing the placeholder to overflow
- **placeholder over the text (or elipse the overflow)**
- **recenter and fade in only on save**
